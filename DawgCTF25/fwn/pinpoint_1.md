The ISO 7816 can be read in wireshark by first decoding the USB device as CCID, and then the USB CCID payload as ISO 7816. 
Three verify instructions are given to the card, with pins 6214, 7901, and 7318. The subsequent responses are `0x63c2` (warning) for 6214 and 7318, and `0x9000` (normal) for 7901. This signals that 7901 is the correct PIN.
