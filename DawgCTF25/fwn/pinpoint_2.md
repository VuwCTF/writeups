Performing the same decoding as in <#1363683157077131295>, we can see that most of the packets are limited. The clocking speed factor is determined in the Set Parameters instruction `Fi/Di selecting clock rate: 0x96`.
Using documentation [from Microchip](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-5474CCCD-F385-4AD7-9759-539BB1019357-en-US-8/GUID-2AF64CCB-117C-4F73-92B9-ABE097EFE1DB.html) we can see that the clock frequency factor labelled `Fi` is the first 4 bits of the number. The value 9 or `1001` corresponds to an `Fi` of 512.
