You start the challenge with getting asked a name. Then it's like a normal combat game except you are to slow to attack. I tried spamming AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA as my name, and it overwrites the bots action each turn. After this go between hitting heavy hits and light hits(the bot does it's aciton based on your last) and win.
