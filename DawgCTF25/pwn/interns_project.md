So you are given a binary. Three options, print hello, print flag, and sign up. You give it one two three. The program checks if you have print flag and if you do it says you don't have perms. However it only checks this for the first input you send. So for example if you send it the command ```1 2``` It says hello then prints the flag for you.

```Here is your flag: DawgCTF{B@d_P3rm1ssi0ns}```
