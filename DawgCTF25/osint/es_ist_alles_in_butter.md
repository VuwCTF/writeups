Prompt translated:
> My friend and I were strolling through a shopping mall during our visit to Germany. While we were there, we got very hungry and decided to go to a supermarket to buy some fresh bread and kebabs. When we got to the store, we were pleasantly surprised to find that they had a bread slicer! It was very convenient. We wanted to go back, but we had forgotten where the store was! Stupid Americans, aren't we? Anyway, we got lucky because my friend happened to be taking a photo in the area because he liked the architecture. Can you help us find the supermarket so we can buy some fresh bread before we fly back?

Google Lens tells us that the building they are in front of is the Schultheiss-Quartier mall. There is a supermarket on the same block called Kaufland Berlin-Moabit.
