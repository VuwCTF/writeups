We are given an image of birds sitting on a wire. We have to figure out what the cipher is to decrypt the message. After some googling I found that there was an alphabet for the birds on a wire, I used the deciphering tool (https://www.cachesleuth.com/codes/birdsonawire.htmlon) CacheSleuth to simplify decoding the message which gave us the decoded message "thereisnoescape".
