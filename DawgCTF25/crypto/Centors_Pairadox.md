You're given a number generated from the flag and the script that produced it. The script works by forming an array with the ASCII values of each letter in the flag and making them into pairs where some operations are then done to produce a single output. This is then done a few more times until one final number is reached. I calculated that to reverse this operation, sqrt(2*output) = sum of inputs + 1 (with an error of approx. 0.5 on either side). You could then figure out the inputs from there (and find the inputs to create each of those etc.). I ran into some issues with math.floor(math.sqrt()) becoming inaccurate at very high numbers, so had to use math.isqrt(), which fixed it. You end up with an array with the flag in it:
Dawg{1_pr3f3r_4ppl3s_t0_pa1rs_4nyw2y5}
