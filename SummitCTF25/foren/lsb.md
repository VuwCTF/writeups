The image has a binary sequence of red and black pixels in the top left corner. Decoding these using black as 0 and red as 1 gives `010100110111010101101101011011010110100101110100010000110101010001000110011110110110110101110011011000100101111101110011011101000110010101100111011011110101111101100011011010000110000101101100011011000110010101101110011001110110010101111101` which can be decoded to
