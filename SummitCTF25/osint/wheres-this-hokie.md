> As you look around Virginia Tech, you may notice these large Hokie Bird statutes. This one seems familiar, but I can't quite put my finger on what building it's located in. Can you help me find this Hokie Bird?!!!

Searching the image provided on TinEye gives a dead link but has an expanded image. This reveals that the bird's name is Hyer A. Hokie. Searching this name gives a link to an art website https://www.gobbledeart.org/products/hyer-a-hokie that shows the back side of the image, containing the building name 'Smith Career Center'.
