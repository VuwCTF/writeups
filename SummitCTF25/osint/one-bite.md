> Pizza is a late night staple here at Virginia Tech, as we all know about the $5 slice. One of pizza's biggest critics came by and rated a local favorite. Can you tell me the score he gave?

At the VT campus, there is a famous $5 slice pizza shop called Benny Marzano's. The pizza review site https://onebitepizzarankings.com gave it a 7.1.
